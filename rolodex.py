IS IT AN OPPORTUNITY 
nine-lived and contradictory
Centered and balanced.
THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE
LETTING THE DAYS GO BY
LETTING THE WATE HOLD ME DOWN
LETTING THE DAYS GO BY 
WATER FLOWING UNDERGROUND
i heard a bird sing 
in the dark of december
a magical thing 
and sweet to remember
"we are nearer to spring 
than we were in september"
i heard a bird sing 
in the dark of december
now i think 
heartbreaking but
also insane. 
also very funny.
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
this place could be beautiful
youcanmake this placebeautiful
BRO! TELL ME WE STILL KNOW 
HOW TO SPEAK OF KINGS!
if i rhyme it is it poetry?
noetry
We can hold all these ideas
andfeel heavy and weightless
with the absurd beauty of itall
What do you want from a poem? 
Isit worth dying to find out?
Some bit of historical bunk
Fillsour grammar w Latinate junk
It banned prepositions
From final positions,
Ita Anglis difficile nunc.
Make the ordinary 
come alive for them.
The extra ordinary will 
take care of itself.
